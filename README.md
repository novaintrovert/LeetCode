Wish I experienced the excitement of cracking these problems back in the days.

I like a challenge.

I wish only to "pass" those problems in summer 2020, highly prefer my code to be "top half" in autumn 2020, be "top 10%" in winter 2020, to be "top 2%" in spring 2020.

Here I only post problems that I'm quite content with, or problems that does not worth further probing. I will gradually rewrite some code I finished earlier & post them here.

Beefing it up, slowly.
